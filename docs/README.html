# BladeDroid

_Notice that most of the provided command line examples work only if you have added your `tools` folder in the Android SDK to the path variable of your system. Do this by running `export PATH=$PATH:"<sdk-dir>/tools"` or adding this line to your `~/.bash_profile`._

## User Scripting (Blade Generation)

To convert eclipse-exported jar file to dalvik, which can be loaded.

    <sdk-dir>/build-tools/<version>/dx --dex --output=output.jar input.jar

Put the resulting `.jar` file onto the external storage of your Android device under:

    /<external_storage>/blades/<package_name>/

Where the `<package_name>` is the package name of the application to script for. (i.e. the project name which is the name of its `apk`)
Every `.jar` file found in this directory will be scanned for classes that inherit from
`AbstractBlade` that are then initiated and executed on every activity event.


## Instrumentation

The process of modifing an existing Android application to be user scriptable, is called instrumentation. This section gives an overview of how to do that.

### Compiling apk

Compile the instrumentation code using `ant` (Buildfile is in project directory). Run it as follows:

    java -Xss50m -Xmx1500m -jar instrument.jar -apk <some-apk-file> -lib bladedroid.jar -aj <sdk-dir>/platforms/android-<num>/android.jar

Here `bladedroid.jar` contains classes for `BladeDroid.java`, `BladeLoader.java` etc

### Adding Permission
The current version of the instrumentation does not automatically add the required `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permission to the `AndroidManifest.xml` file. For this, the following tag has to be added as a child node of the `manifest` tag.

    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />

This can be done using `apktool d -s <my-apk.apk>` as explained further down.

### Signing

Use `jarsigner` to sign the new modified `.apk` with your private key. The full details can be found in the [Android docs](http://developer.android.com/tools/publishing/app-signing.html). A short outline is provided here.

#### Retrieve a keypair

You can generate a keypair using the `keytool` command line tool. The following example generates a key pair that is valid for `10000` days (i.e. more than 27 years).

    $ keytool -genkey -v -keystore <my-release-key>.keystore -alias <alias_name> -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000

#### Sign your instrumented application

You can use the provided `jarsigner` tool to sign your instrumented `.apk` file.

    $ jarsigner -verbose -sigalg SHA1withRSA -digestalg SHA1 -keystore <my-release-key.keystore> <instrumented_apk> <alias_name>

#### Debug Key

You can also use the standard debug key `debug.keystore` (in `~/.android/`) with alias `android` and password `android`. Consult the [documentation](https://developer.android.com/tools/publishing/app-signing.html#debugmode) for details. The debug key is automatically generated when running the app through eclipse or using `ant debug`. Otherwise you can generate it by running

    keytool -genkey -v -keystore ~/.android/debug.keystore -storepass android -alias androiddebugkey -keypass android -dname "CN=Android Debug,O=Android,C=US"

#### Possible Errors

It is possible, that the signing process fails with an error message like:

    jarsigner: unable to sign jar: java.util.zip.ZipException: invalid entry compressed size (expected 462 but got 464 bytes)

This usually happens if the application is already signed and you try to sign it again with a production key. In this case you have to remove the `META-INF` folder from within the APK before you can sign it again. (unzip it, remove the folder and zip it again) __This should be automated__


### Aligning

Use `zipalign` to optimize the final `.apk`:

    $ zipalign -v -f 4 <unaligned-apk> <aligned-apk>

where the `aligned-apk` should have the name it had before you instrumented it which is the project name. The added `-f` flag instructs the tool to overwrite existing files.

### Running new APK on Emulator

First start the emulator, either through eclipse, or through

    android avd

then run (`-r` to overwrite existing installations)

    adb install -r <new-apk-file.apk>

### Modifying apk
To alter an `.apk` file manually use the `apktool` as provided by Google [here](https://code.google.com/p/android-apktool/). Possible tasks inlcude:

 - Manual changes to AndroidManifest
 - Looking for implementation details of apps to write Blades for

To decompile use:

    apktool d <your_apk.apk> [<output_dir>]

To recompile (i.e. _build_):

    apktool b [<app_path>] [<out_file>]

If you just want to change either source code or resources, use the `-s` and `-r` flags repsectively during decompilation. (Will only decompile the wanted parts)
