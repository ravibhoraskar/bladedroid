# BladeDroid

## User Scripting (Blade Generation)

To convert eclipse-exported jar file to dalvik, which can be loaded.

    <sdk-dir>/build-tools/<version>/dx --dex --output=output.jar input.jar

Put the resulting `.jar` file onto the external storage of your Android device under:

    /<external_storage>/blades/<package_name>/

Where the `<package_name>` is the package name of the application to script for.
Every `.jar` file found in this directory will be scanned for classes that inherit from
`AbstractBlade` that are then initiated and executed on every activity event.

## Instrumentation

Compile the instrumentation code using ant. Run it as follows:

    java -jar instrument.jar -apk <some-apk-file> -lib bladedroid.jar -aj <sdk-dir>/platforms/android-<num>/android.jar

Here `bladedroid.jar` contains classes for `BladeDroid.java`, `BladeLoader.java` etc
